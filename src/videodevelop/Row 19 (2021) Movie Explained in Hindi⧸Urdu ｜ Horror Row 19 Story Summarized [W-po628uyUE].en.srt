she
came out of her thoughts, where Katia was continuously looking at a place,

441
00:08:11,350 --> 00:08:11,360
came out of her thoughts, where Katia was continuously looking at a place,
 

442
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:13,469

Bleeding also starts coming from the pilot's head, which becomes so
much that he collapses there and

617
00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:31,920
much that he collapses there and
 

618
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:34,110
much that he collapses there and
dies on the spot.

619
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:34,120
dies on the spot.
 

620
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:36,430
dies on the spot.
Obviously, seeing this, Katia becomes more nervous and

621
00:11:36,430 --> 00:11:36,440
Obviously, seeing this, Katia becomes more nervous and
 

622
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:38,750
Obviously, seeing this, Katia becomes more nervous and
now she breaks the door of the pilot's cabin,

623
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:38,760
now she breaks the door of the pilot's cabin,
 

624
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:40,750
now she breaks the door of the pilot's cabin,
but to do so  Even after this, she

625
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:43,069
but to do so  Even after this, she
 

626
00:11:43,069 --> 00:11:43,079
 
 

627
00:11:43,079 --> 00:11:45,550
 
finds not the pilot's cabin but another cabin of the plane where it was empty all day

628
00:11:45,550 --> 00:11:45,560
finds not the pilot's cabin but another cabin of the plane where it was empty all day
 

629
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:47,790
finds not the pilot's cabin but another cabin of the plane where it was empty all day
and it was exactly the same cabin as the

630
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:47,800
and it was exactly the same cabin as the
 

631
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:49,829
and it was exactly the same cabin as the
plane of her childhood. Now again Katia

632
00:11:49,829 --> 00:11:49,839
plane of her childhood. Now again Katia
 

633
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:51,949
plane of her childhood. Now again Katia
moves ahead and opens the pilot's cabin

634
00:11:51,949 --> 00:11:51,959
moves ahead and opens the pilot's cabin
 

635
00:11:51,959 --> 00:11:53,829
moves ahead and opens the pilot's cabin
but she  Again, she

636
00:11:53,829 --> 00:11:53,839
but she  Again, she
 

637
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:56,230
but she  Again, she
gets a plane cabin with seats. By doing this again and again, she

638
00:11:56,230 --> 00:11:56,240
gets a plane cabin with seats. By doing this again and again, she
 

639
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,990
gets a plane cabin with seats. By doing this again and again, she
was coming to the passenger cabin only, due to

640
00:11:57,990 --> 00:11:58,000
was coming to the passenger cabin only, due to
 

641
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,230
was coming to the passenger cabin only, due to
which Katia felt as if she was

642
00:12:00,230 --> 00:12:00,240
which Katia felt as if she was
 

643
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:02,509
which Katia felt as if she was
stuck in a loop, this thing is not ending, it is

644
00:12:02,509 --> 00:12:02,519
stuck in a loop, this thing is not ending, it is
 

645
00:12:02,519 --> 00:12:04,590
stuck in a loop, this thing is not ending, it is
happening again and again.  But now

646
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:04,600
happening again and again.  But now
 

647
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:06,910
happening again and again.  But now
suddenly Katia sees that my daughter is

648
00:12:06,910 --> 00:12:06,920
suddenly Katia sees that my daughter is
 

649
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:09,509
suddenly Katia sees that my daughter is
sitting on row number 19, who was calling her mom

650
00:12:09,509 --> 00:12:09,519
sitting on row number 19, who was calling her mom
 

651
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:11,750
sitting on row number 19, who was calling her mom
to her. Now then Katia

652
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:11,760
to her. Now then Katia
 

653
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:13,990
to her. Now then Katia
sees a Sai very close to her daughter, so to

654
00:12:13,990 --> 00:12:14,000
sees a Sai very close to her daughter, so to
 

655
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,829
sees a Sai very close to her daughter, so to
save her daughter, she quickly runs.  She

656
00:12:15,829 --> 00:12:15,839
save her daughter, she quickly runs.  She
 

657
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:18,310
save her daughter, she quickly runs.  She
runs towards that place where she saw that it was

658
00:12:18,310 --> 00:12:18,320
runs towards that place where she saw that it was
 

659
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,430
runs towards that place where she saw that it was
none other than the shadow of the same old woman,

660
00:12:20,430 --> 00:12:20,440
none other than the shadow of the same old woman,
 

661
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:22,629
none other than the shadow of the same old woman,
that is, whom she had seen in her childhood before the plane was destroyed.

662
00:12:22,629 --> 00:12:22,639
that is, whom she had seen in her childhood before the plane was destroyed.
 

663
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:24,430
that is, whom she had seen in her childhood before the plane was destroyed.
Here the elder woman

664
00:12:24,430 --> 00:12:24,440
Here the elder woman
 

665
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:26,710
Here the elder woman
tells Katya that at that time when the plane was about to be

666
00:12:26,710 --> 00:12:26,720
tells Katya that at that time when the plane was about to be
 

667
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,790
tells Katya that at that time when the plane was about to be
destroyed, I  I had put you to sleep

668
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:28,800
destroyed, I  I had put you to sleep
 

669
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,870
destroyed, I  I had put you to sleep
because at that time I did not want

670
00:12:30,870 --> 00:12:30,880
because at that time I did not want
 

671
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,910
because at that time I did not want
you or your mother to die,

672
00:12:32,910 --> 00:12:32,920
you or your mother to die,
 

673
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:34,990
you or your mother to die,
but your mother had died in that plane crash,

674
00:12:34,990 --> 00:12:35,000
but your mother had died in that plane crash,
 

675
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,189
but your mother had died in that plane crash,
so now I want

676
00:12:37,189 --> 00:12:37,199
so now I want
 

677
00:12:37,199 --> 00:12:39,430
so now I want
you to go to the past and learn about the things that happened at that time of the plane crash.  She

678
00:12:39,430 --> 00:12:41,710
you to go to the past and learn about the things that happened at that time of the plane crash.  She
 

679
00:12:41,710 --> 00:12:41,720
 
 

680
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:44,230
 
says this and the old woman frees Katia from her magic,

681
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:44,240
says this and the old woman frees Katia from her magic,
 

682
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:46,389
says this and the old woman frees Katia from her magic,
that is, now Katia's

683
00:12:46,389 --> 00:12:46,399
that is, now Katia's
 

684
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:48,550
that is, now Katia's
fate was in her own hands. Well, now

00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:48,560
fate was in her own hands. Well, now
 

686
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:51,230

we saw that Katia comes back to her past at the
 

688
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:53,230
we saw that Katia comes back to her past at the
time when the plane crash

689
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:53,240
time when the plane crash
 

690
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:55,269
time when the plane crash
occurs.  Here all the same passengers were

722
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:28,670
goes back to herself when she
was a child where we see the destruction of the plane.  The

00:13:28,670 --> 00:13:28,680
was a child where we see the destruction of the plane.  The
 

724
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:30,790
was a child where we see the destruction of the plane.  The
same scene which we had

725
00:13:30,790 --> 00:13:30,800
same scene which we had
 

726
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,710

pulls her mom and makes her lie down on row number 19,
 

732
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:39,790
pulls her mom and makes her lie down on row number 19,
after which the plane gets destroyed and

733
00:13:39,790 --> 00:13:39,800
after which the plane gets destroyed and
 

734
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:42,310
