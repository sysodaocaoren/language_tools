56
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:05,350
he decides.  He thinks that he should explore this planet
so that he can get some kind of

00:01:05,350 --> 00:01:05,360
so that he can get some kind of
 

58
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:07,230
so that he can get some kind of
communication system

59
00:01:07,230 --> 00:01:07,240
communication system
 

60
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:09,510
communication system
through which he will be able to call for help from the Earth.

61
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:09,520
through which he will be able to call for help from the Earth.
 

62
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:11,310
through which he will be able to call for help from the Earth.
Also, one good thing about this planet is that

63
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:11,320
Also, one good thing about this planet is that
 

64
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:13,190
Also, one good thing about this planet is that
it is exactly like the Earth's atmosphere so

65
00:01:13,190 --> 00:01:13,200
it is exactly like the Earth's atmosphere so
 

66
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,950
it is exactly like the Earth's atmosphere so
that  Max does

67
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:14,960
that  Max does
 

68
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:16,749
that  Max does
not have any problem in breathing. Now as soon as Max

69
00:01:16,749 --> 00:01:16,759
not have any problem in breathing. Now as soon as Max
 

70
00:01:16,759 --> 00:01:18,590
not have any problem in breathing. Now as soon as Max
moves forward, there comes a soldier named Jeff

71
00:01:18,590 --> 00:01:18,600
moves forward, there comes a soldier named Jeff
 

72
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:20,710
moves forward, there comes a soldier named Jeff
who lives on this planet.

73
00:01:20,710 --> 00:01:20,720
who lives on this planet.
 

74
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:22,630
who lives on this planet.
Max does not understand his language,

75
00:01:22,630 --> 00:01:22,640
Max does not understand his language,
 

76
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:24,350
Max does not understand his language,
so he uses the translating device

77
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:24,360
so he uses the translating device
 

78
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:26,109
so he uses the translating device
in his work.  Jeff puts it on so that he can

79
00:01:26,109 --> 00:01:26,119
in his work.  Jeff puts it on so that he can
 

80
00:01:26,119 --> 00:01:28,230
in his work.  Jeff puts it on so that he can
understand his language and talk to him, after which

81
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:28,240
understand his language and talk to him, after which
 

82
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:30,429
understand his language and talk to him, after which
Jeff hands Max over to the people of authority

83
00:01:30,429 --> 00:01:30,439
Jeff hands Max over to the people of authority
 

84
00:01:30,439 --> 00:01:32,389
Jeff hands Max over to the people of authority
so that he can handle it himself, then they

85
00:01:32,389 --> 00:01:34,230
so that he can handle it himself, then they
 

86
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:34,240
 
 

87
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:36,149
 
put some kind of helmet on Max's head and see all his memories on the screen.

88
00:01:36,149 --> 00:01:38,109
put some kind of helmet on Max's head and see all his memories on the screen.
 

89
00:01:38,109 --> 00:01:38,119
 
 

90
00:01:38,119 --> 00:01:40,230
 
Now all the

91
00:01:40,230 --> 00:01:40,240
Now all the
 

92
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:41,830
Now all the
soldiers take Max to the city's capital,

93
00:01:41,830 --> 00:01:41,840
soldiers take Max to the city's capital,
 

94
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,830
soldiers take Max to the city's capital,
where while passing through the way,

95
00:01:43,830 --> 00:01:43,840
where while passing through the way,
 

96
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:46,030
where while passing through the way,
Max also sees the common people living on this planet

97
00:01:46,030 --> 00:01:46,040
Max also sees the common people living on this planet
 

98
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:47,789
Max also sees the common people living on this planet
who are looking for food.  They are

99
00:01:47,789 --> 00:01:47,799
who are looking for food.  They are
 

100
00:01:47,799 --> 00:01:49,630
who are looking for food.  They are
fighting with each other for the things to drink.

101
00:01:49,630 --> 00:01:49,640
fighting with each other for the things to drink.
 

102
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:51,910
fighting with each other for the things to drink.
Seeing the whole environment around, it seems

103
00:01:51,910 --> 00:01:51,920
Seeing the whole environment around, it seems
 

104
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:53,670
Seeing the whole environment around, it seems
that the people here are fighting for freedom,

105
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:53,680
that the people here are fighting for freedom,
 

106
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,510
that the people here are fighting for freedom,
then while moving ahead, Max's eyes

107
00:01:55,510 --> 00:01:55,520
then while moving ahead, Max's eyes
 

108
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,469
then while moving ahead, Max's eyes
fall on a tower. The people here are fighting for this tower.  They

109
00:01:57,469 --> 00:01:57,479
fall on a tower. The people here are fighting for this tower.  They
 

110
00:01:57,479 --> 00:01:59,310
fall on a tower. The people here are fighting for this tower.  They
believe that it

111
00:01:59,310 --> 00:01:59,320
believe that it
 

112
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:01,350
believe that it
protects them from the enemies, but then suddenly the

113
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:01,360
protects them from the enemies, but then suddenly the
 

114
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:03,429
protects them from the enemies, but then suddenly the
tower explodes, the debris of which falls

115
00:02:03,429 --> 00:02:05,190
tower explodes, the debris of which falls
 

116
00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:05,200
 
 

117
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,149
 
on Max and all the people present along with him, many

118
00:02:07,149 --> 00:02:07,159
on Max and all the people present along with him, many
 

119
00:02:07,159 --> 00:02:08,749
on Max and all the people present along with him, many
people are killed in this, but the tank in which

120
00:02:08,749 --> 00:02:08,759
people are killed in this, but the tank in which
 

121
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:10,630
people are killed in this, but the tank in which
Max was present in it, a soldier named James

122
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:10,640
Max was present in it, a soldier named James
 

123
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:12,430
Max was present in it, a soldier named James
also joins him, so Max

124
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:12,440
also joins him, so Max
 

125
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:14,150
also joins him, so Max
somehow gets out of the tank and comes away,

126
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:14,160
somehow gets out of the tank and comes away,
 

127
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:16,190
somehow gets out of the tank and comes away,
which saves both their lives. Then

128
00:02:16,190 --> 00:02:16,200
which saves both their lives. Then
 

129
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:17,990
which saves both their lives. Then
James tells Max that if our

130
00:02:17,990 --> 00:02:18,000
James tells Max that if our
 

131
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,910
James tells Max that if our
enemies have any business, they are always in this.  They

132
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:19,920
enemies have any business, they are always in this.  They
 

133
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,949
enemies have any business, they are always in this.  They
wanted to destroy the tower, in which today they have succeeded,

134
00:02:21,949 --> 00:02:21,959
wanted to destroy the tower, in which today they have succeeded,
 

135
00:02:21,959 --> 00:02:23,910
wanted to destroy the tower, in which today they have succeeded,
now they don't know what will be their next step,

136
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:23,920
now they don't know what will be their next step,
 

137
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:25,949
now they don't know what will be their next step,
now Max is also surprised to hear

138
00:02:25,949 --> 00:02:25,959
now Max is also surprised to hear
 

139
00:02:25,959 --> 00:02:27,949
now Max is also surprised to hear
that here also the fight does not end anywhere,

140
00:02:27,949 --> 00:02:27,959
that here also the fight does not end anywhere,
 

141
00:02:27,959 --> 00:02:30,190
that here also the fight does not end anywhere,
meaning on the other hand, the head of the Special Research

142
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:30,200
meaning on the other hand, the head of the Special Research
 

143
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:32,470
meaning on the other hand, the head of the Special Research
Department, whose  His name is Nomad. He

144
00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:32,480
Department, whose  His name is Nomad. He
 

145
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:34,229
Department, whose  His name is Nomad. He
tells one of his friends, Frank, that

146
00:02:34,229 --> 00:02:34,239
tells one of his friends, Frank, that
 

147
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:35,990
tells one of his friends, Frank, that
wherever Max is, find him immediately and bring him to me.

148
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:36,000
wherever Max is, find him immediately and bring him to me.
 

149
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,110
wherever Max is, find him immediately and bring him to me.
I suspect that he might be a spy.

150
00:02:38,110 --> 00:02:38,120
I suspect that he might be a spy.
 

151
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:40,070
I suspect that he might be a spy.
Then Frank agrees and sets out to

152
00:02:40,070 --> 00:02:40,080
Then Frank agrees and sets out to
 

153
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,750
Then Frank agrees and sets out to
find Max.

154
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:41,760
find Max.
 

155
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,350
find Max.
So we also see a man named David,

00:02:43,350 --> 00:02:43,360
So we also see a man named David,

00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:45,200
he also asks his partner to find out as much
 

159
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,030

but releases such radiation
 

341
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,390
but releases such radiation
that all the people come under the control of radiation

342
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:43,400
that all the people come under the control of radiation
 

343
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:45,309
that all the people come under the control of radiation
and once a person comes

344
00:05:45,309 --> 00:05:45,319
and once a person comes
 

345
00:05:45,319 --> 00:05:47,510
and once a person comes
under the control of radiation, he will hear,

under the control of radiation, he will hear,
say and do the same thing.  Whatever the authority asks him to

say and do the same thing.  Whatever the authority asks him to
 

349
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:51,670

do, that person becomes a puppet of the authority,
 

351
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,909
do, that person becomes a puppet of the authority,

who are not affected by radiation
 

355
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,710
who are not affected by radiation
and whenever the wave of radiation passes through that person,

356
00:05:57,710 --> 00:05:57,720
and whenever the wave of radiation passes through that person,
 

357
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:00,110
and whenever the wave of radiation passes through that person,
he only gets seizure attack

491
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:11,960
when David comes to know that Max's body is also revealed.  He
 

492
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:13,909
when David comes to know that Max's body is also revealed.  He
is like a person on whom no radiation has any effect,

493
00:08:13,909 --> 00:08:13,919
is like a person on whom no radiation has any effect,
 

494
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:16,070

Here Max tells Jeff and the man

507
00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:28,240
Here Max tells Jeff and the man
 

508
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:30,230
Here Max tells Jeff and the man
that what if he blows up the center of authority

509
00:08:30,230 --> 00:08:30,240
that what if he blows up the center of authority
 

510
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,950
that what if he blows up the center of authority
from where they control all the towers,

511
00:08:31,950 --> 00:08:31,960
from where they control all the towers,
 

512
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:33,550
from where they control all the towers,
meaning from where all the  The

513
00:08:33,550 --> 00:08:33,560
meaning from where all the  The
 

514
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:35,630
meaning from where all the  The
towers get power, this will mean that

515
00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:35,640
towers get power, this will mean that
 

516
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,509
towers get power, this will mean that
all the towers will shut down simultaneously but

517
00:08:37,509 --> 00:08:37,519
all the towers will shut down simultaneously but
 

518
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:39,630
all the towers will shut down simultaneously but
Jeff says that this is not possible. The towers have been

519
00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:39,640
Jeff says that this is not possible. The towers have been
 

520
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:41,589
Jeff says that this is not possible. The towers have been
designed in a very different way

521
00:08:41,589 --> 00:08:41,599
designed in a very different way
 

522
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:42,949
designed in a very different way
that no one knows

523
00:08:42,949 --> 00:08:42,959
that no one knows
 

524
00:08:42,959 --> 00:08:44,790
that no one knows
how and from where they operate.  Now after

525
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:44,800
how and from where they operate.  Now after
 

526
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,590
how and from where they operate.  Now after
hearing this, Max again gets worried as to

527
00:08:46,590 --> 00:08:46,600
hearing this, Max again gets worried as to
 

528
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,870
hearing this, Max again gets worried as to
what to do if he does. Jeff further tells

529
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:48,880
what to do if he does. Jeff further tells
 

530
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,509
what to do if he does. Jeff further tells
that there are many people living in the South who are

531
00:08:50,509 --> 00:08:50,519
that there are many people living in the South who are
 

532
00:08:50,519 --> 00:08:52,790
that there are many people living in the South who are
not affected by radiation but they have nothing to do with the

533
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:52,800
not affected by radiation but they have nothing to do with the
 

534
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,590
not affected by radiation but they have nothing to do with the
people of our city.  They wo

535
00:08:54,590 --> 00:08:54,600
people of our city.  They wo
 

536
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:56,389
people of our city.  They wo
n't even help us. Just

537
00:08:56,389 --> 00:08:56,399
n't even help us. Just
 

538
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:58,350
n't even help us. Just
then an automatic tank comes there and

539
00:08:58,350 --> 00:08:58,360
then an automatic tank comes there and
 

540
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:00,110
then an automatic tank comes there and
starts attacking everyone, but Max

541
00:09:00,110 --> 00:09:00,120
starts attacking everyone, but Max
 

542
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:02,350
starts attacking everyone, but Max
somehow risks his life and enters the tank

543
00:09:02,350 --> 00:09:02,360
somehow risks his life and enters the tank
 

544
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:04,269
somehow risks his life and enters the tank
and switches off its automatic control system.

545
00:09:04,269 --> 00:09:04,279
and switches off its automatic control system.
 

546
00:09:04,279 --> 00:09:06,269
and switches off its automatic control system.
Now Max is alone in the tank.  He

547
00:09:06,269 --> 00:09:06,279
Now Max is alone in the tank.  He
 

548
00:09:06,279 --> 00:09:08,069
Now Max is alone in the tank.  He
comes near the border of the city with a tank so that he can

549
00:09:08,069 --> 00:09:08,079
comes near the border of the city with a tank so that he can
 

550
00:09:08,079 --> 00:09:10,110
comes near the border of the city with a tank so that he can
go south from there and

551
00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:10,120
go south from there and
 

552
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:11,870
go south from there and
convince them to join his team, but

553
00:09:11,870 --> 00:09:11,880
convince them to join his team, but
 

554
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:13,670
convince them to join his team, but
after crossing the border, soldiers stop Max.

555
00:09:13,670 --> 00:09:13,680
after crossing the border, soldiers stop Max.
 

556
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,350
after crossing the border, soldiers stop Max.
Max sees James among them,

557
00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:15,360
Max sees James among them,
 

558
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,509
Max sees James among them,
so he kills him.  After putting it in his tank, he

559
00:09:17,509 --> 00:09:17,519
so he kills him.  After putting it in his tank, he
 

560
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:19,509
so he kills him.  After putting it in his tank, he
breaks all the barricades and comes outside the border,

561
00:09:19,509 --> 00:09:19,519
breaks all the barricades and comes outside the border,
 

562
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:21,269
breaks all the barricades and comes outside the border,
where on the way he again

563
00:09:21,269 --> 00:09:21,279
where on the way he again
 

564
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:23,110
where on the way he again
tries to convince James that the

565
00:09:23,110 --> 00:09:23,120
tries to convince James that the
 

566
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:25,030
tries to convince James that the
authority is really controlling everyone through radiation, only then

567
00:09:25,030 --> 00:09:25,040
authority is really controlling everyone through radiation, only then
 

568
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:26,949

James
 

570
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:28,470
James
believes this.  This happens because

571
00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:28,480
believes this.  This happens because
 

572
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,670
believes this.  This happens because
after crossing the border the effect of radiation had reduced on him,

573
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:30,680
after crossing the border the effect of radiation had reduced on him,
 

574
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:32,550
after crossing the border the effect of radiation had reduced on him,
due to this he becomes very angry
